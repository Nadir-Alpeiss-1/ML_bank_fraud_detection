## Task
The main goal is to design a fraud detection model which can help a financial organization to prevent fraud transactions and, hence, to maximize its revenue
by collecting all the transactions fees. The dataset is given. So the task was to analyze the data and to choose suitable model. 

## Description
To solve the problem I read corresponding articles and used experience from the previous tasks. 
In particular, I used scaler and logistic regression model which resulted in quite accurate model which can predict fraud operations. 

## Installation
One need to enter in the console the following: "jypyter notebook --no-browser" (without commas), then copy the link and open a new one adding 
"web-" just after https://. 
Then enter "qwasar" (without commas) as a password. 
Choose My_paypal file and then just press play button several times, so one can see that code works.

## Usage
Pressing play button will enable jupyter notebook to run the code, so that everything is seen for a user. 
In addition there are some headings which can help in navigaing thoughout the document. At the end of the code the accuracy of the model is given.

### The Core Team
I solved this problem by myself, since this task is designed to be solved by one person only. This was very useful in terms of gaining some experience in solving
such kind of problems and formatting as well.
